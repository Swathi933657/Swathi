1. What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud Computing means using internet-based servers to:
-Store data
-Run applications
-Host websites
-Analyze big data
-Deploy AI/ML models
-Instead of running your code or database on your own computer, you run it on remote servers (“the cloud”).

Simple Example:
When you run a Python web app on your laptop, only you can access it.
But if you deploy it to the cloud, anyone with internet can access it (like a real website).

2. What is AWS (Amazon Web Services)?

AWS = Amazon Web Services
It’s one of the largest cloud platforms in the world.
it provides hundreds of services for:

-Hosting web apps
-Storing files (S3)
-Running virtual machines (EC2)
-Managing databases (RDS, DynamoDB)
-Deploying AI/ML models (SageMaker)
-Serverless computing (Lambda)

How Python is used with AWS
You can use Python to interact with AWS using:
Boto3 → AWS’s official Python SDK (Software Development Kit).

3. What is GCP (Google Cloud Platform)?
GCP = Google Cloud Platform — Google’s cloud service.
It offers similar tools to AWS, such as:
-Compute Engine – run virtual machines
-Cloud Storage – store files
-BigQuery – analyze data
-AI Platform – train and deploy ML models
-Cloud Functions – run serverless Python functions.

Python Fits into Cloud Computing

Python is widely used in the cloud for:

Use Case	        Example
- Web Apps	        Flask/Django hosted on AWS EC2 or GCP Compute Engine
- Machine Learning	Train models with TensorFlow on Google AI Platform or AWS SageMaker
- Serverless Apps	Run Python functions using AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions
- Data Processing	Use Python + BigQuery / AWS Glue for big data
- Automation	        Python scripts automate cloud tasks (e.g., starting servers, uploading files)
