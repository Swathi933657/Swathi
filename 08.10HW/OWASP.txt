OWASP:
OWASP stands for Open Web Application Security Project.
It‚Äôs not specific to Python, but it‚Äôs a global organization that provides standards, tools, and best practices to help developers build secure web applications ‚Äî including those built with Python.

OWASP Applies to Python Web Apps
You can apply OWASP principles to frameworks like:
üî∏ Flask
Disable debug mode in production.
Validate and sanitize all input (wtforms, bleach).
Use Flask-Talisman for HTTPS and security headers.
üî∏ Django
Use Django‚Äôs built-in CSRF, XSS, SQL injection protection.
Don‚Äôt expose sensitive info in settings.py.
Keep Django and dependencies up to date.

OWASP Tools Useful for Python Developers:

| Tool                             | Purpose                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy)** | Scans your web app for vulnerabilities (like SQLi, XSS) |
| **Dependency-Check**             | Detects vulnerable libraries in your Python environment |
| **Cheat Sheet Series**           | Provides best practices for secure coding               |
| **OWASP Dependency Track**       | Monitors security of dependencies continuously          |

OWASP Top 10 ‚Äî Most Common Web Security Risks:
OWASP publishes a list of the Top 10 web application security risks, which every Python web developer should know.
| Rank | Vulnerability                                  | Example in Python                                    | Description                                          |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | **Broken Access Control**                      | Not checking user permissions in Flask/Django routes | Users can access data they shouldn‚Äôt                 |
| 2    | **Cryptographic Failures**                     | Using weak or no encryption                          | Sensitive data like passwords not properly encrypted |
| 3    | **Injection**                                  | SQL Injection using raw queries                      | Malicious input modifies SQL queries                 |
| 4    | **Insecure Design**                            | No validation or threat modeling                     | Weak design allowing abuse                           |
| 5    | **Security Misconfiguration**                  | Debug mode ON in Flask/Django in production          | Misconfigured server reveals sensitive data          |
| 6    | **Vulnerable and Outdated Components**         | Using old Python packages                            | Older libraries with known exploits                  |
| 7    | **Identification and Authentication Failures** | Weak password system                                 | Login bypass or brute force attacks                  |
| 8    | **Software and Data Integrity Failures**       | Using unverified dependencies                        | Code tampering or malicious packages                 |
| 9    | **Security Logging and Monitoring Failures**   | No error logging                                     | Security incidents go unnoticed                      |
| 10   | **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**         | Fetching external URLs without validation            | Attacker makes server call unauthorized URLs         |
