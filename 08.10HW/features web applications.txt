Main Features of Web Applications in Python
1. Framework Support
Python provides many powerful web frameworks that make development faster and easier:
Django – full-stack, batteries-included framework (for large apps)
Flask – lightweight and flexible (for small to medium apps)
FastAPI – modern, fast, supports async operations (for APIs)
Pyramid, Tornado, Bottle – other popular frameworks

✅These frameworks handle:
URL routing
Templates (HTML rendering)
Database connection (ORM)
User authentication

2. Platform Independent
Python web applications can run on any OS (Windows, macOS, Linux).
You can deploy them on cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, Heroku, Google Cloud, etc.

3. Built-in Libraries and Packages
Python has a large standard library and community packages (via PyPI) for:
File handling
JSON/XML parsing
Database interaction (SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL)
API integration
Security, encryption, etc.

4. Scalability and Flexibility
You can start small (like a personal blog) and scale up to enterprise-level systems with load balancing and caching (using Redis, Celery, etc.).

5. Database Integration
Supports multiple databases:
Relational: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite
NoSQL: MongoDB, Cassandra, Firebase
Frameworks like Django use ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to simplify database queries.

6. Security Features
Python frameworks include built-in security mechanisms:
CSRF protection
XSS protection
SQL injection prevention
Authentication and authorization systems

7. RESTful API Development
Using frameworks like Flask-RESTful or FastAPI, you can build REST APIs easily that connect to web/mobile apps.

8. Templating Engines
Frameworks include templating systems for generating dynamic HTML pages:
Jinja2 (used in Flask)
Django Template Language

9. Session and Cookie Management
Python web apps handle user sessions, cookies, and login states efficiently.

10. Testing and Debugging
Most frameworks include built-in tools for:
Unit testing
Debugging
Error logging
