#Meanin
# If the file is run directly (e.g. python myfile.py), then __name__ is set to "__main__".
#If the file is imported as a module in another file, then __name__ is set to the moduleâ€™s name (e.g. "myfile").
#So the code inside if __name__ == "__main__": will only run when the file is executed directly, not when import
