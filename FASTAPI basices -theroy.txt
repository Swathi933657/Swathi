1.What is FASTAPI  and why is it popular?
ANS:FastAPI is a modern Python framework used to build APIs (web applications) quickly and efficiently.
It is based on Python 3.6+, and uses ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface).
It is mainly used for:
✔️ Building REST APIs
✔️ Handling HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
✔️ Fast backend development.

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")   # GET request
def home():
    return {"message": "Welcome to FastAPI!"}


2.What is Difference between FastAPI and Flask?
ANS:FastAPI vs Flask:
| Feature                  | **FastAPI**                            | **Flask**                     |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Speed**                | 🚀 Very fast (supports async)          | 🐢 Slower compared to FastAPI |
| **Type Checking**        | ✔ Uses Python type hints (less errors) | ❌ No built-in type checking   |
| **Automatic API Docs**   | ✔ YES (Swagger & ReDoc)                | ❌ NO (needs extra packages)   |
| **Asynchronous Support** | ✔ Built-in async/await support         | ❌ Not built-in                |
| **Learning Curve**       | 🧠 Easy and modern                     | 😊 Very easy, simple          |
| **Best For**             | APIs, ML models, production apps       | Small apps, beginners         |
| **Used By**              | Uber, Netflix, Microsoft               | Pinterest, Mozilla            |

Flask:
Older framework (released in 2010)
Good for simple projects
Requires extra libraries for authentication, database, validation, etc.
Does not support async natively

CODE:

from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def home():
    return "Hello from Flask!"

FastAPI:
New (released in 2018)
Designed for fast performance and APIs
Automatically creates API documentation
Supports async / await (better for real-time apps)

CODE:
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def home():
    return {"message": "Hello from FastAPI!"}



3.What is ASGI and WSGI?
ANS:WSGI:
WSGI is the older Python standard.
Works only with synchronous (one-by-one) requests.
Good for simple web pages.
Not good for live chat, notifications, video calls, real-time apps.

👉 Used in : Flask, old Django, Pyramid, Bottle
client → Request → WSGI → Response → Client

 ASGI:
ASGI is the modern version of WSGI.
Supports asynchronous requests (multiple at a time)
Better for real-time apps like chat, streaming, games
Can handle WebSockets

👉 Used in : FastAPI, Django (3.0+), Starlette

Multiple Clients → ASGI → Fast & Real-time Responses

🧾 Diagram
WSGI (Old Way)      →  One request at a time ⏳  
ASGI (New Way)      →  Handles many requests at once ⚡

WSGI vs ASGI:
| Feature        | **WSGI**                          | **ASGI**                                     |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Full Form      | Web Server Gateway Interface      | Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface        |
| Type           | Synchronous (1 request at a time) | Asynchronous (handles many requests at once) |
| Speed          | Slower                            | Faster                                       |
| Real-time apps | ❌ Not suitable                    | ✔ Supports real-time apps                    |
| Best For       | Old/traditional web apps          | Modern, fast APIs & web apps                 |
| Used In        | Flask, Django (old versions)      | FastAPI, Django (new versions)               |



4.What is pydantic's role in FastAPI?
ANS:Pydantic is a Python library used for:
✔️ Data validation
✔️ Data parsing
✔️ Type checking
It helps ensure that incoming data (like API requests) is correct and safe.

Pydantic’s Role in FastAPI:
| Purpose               | What Pydantic Does                                                    |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 📝 Validate data      | Checks if the data is correct (e.g., email format, integer vs string) |
| 📦 Create data models | Defines request & response structures                                 |
| 🛡️ Prevent errors    | Catches wrong input before it breaks code                             |
| 📄 API docs           | Helps FastAPI generate clear documentation automatically              |


5.What is Dependency injection?
ANS: Dependency Injection (DI) means giving the required tools (dependencies) to a function or class instead of creating them inside it.
👉 It helps to reuse code, write cleaner programs, and test easily.

Without DI:
def get_data():
    db = Database()  # created inside function
    return db.fetch()
⚠ Problem: If we want to use another database, testing becomes difficult because the database is fixed inside the function.

With Dependency Injection:
def get_data(db: Database):  # Dependency is passed to the function
    return db.fetch()

Now we can easily change or replace the database:

python
Copy code
db = Database()
get_data(db)   # easy and flexible

Dependency Injection useful:
✔ Makes code reusable
✔ Easy to test
✔ Reduces errors
✔ Cleaner & more organized code
✔ We can replace parts easily (plug-and-play)

Dependency Injection in FastAPI:
FastAPI supports DI automatically using the Depends() function.

EXAMPLE:
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends

app = FastAPI()

# Dependency function
def get_db():
    return "Database Connected"

@app.get("/items/")
def read_items(db=Depends(get_db)):
    return {"message": db}

Conclusion:

Dependency Injection = Giving tools instead of creating them.
It helps write clean, flexible, and testable code.
FastAPI makes DI very easy using Depends().
